### Project Description
Ever wondered if your trash is treasure? Binwise uses AI to analyze objects, score their recyclability, and suggest the best ways to recycle them. Let‚Äôs turn waste into wisdom! ‚ôªÔ∏è

### The Problem statement
The absence of clear recycling guidance and motivation results in recyclable materials being discarded, contributing to pollution and resource depletion.
